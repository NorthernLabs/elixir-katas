# Elixir Katas

Collection of short exercises to learn the [Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org). Inspired by [lambdaclass/erlings](https://github.com/lambdaclass/erlings).

To learn about the language syntax, please take a look at [Elixir's Getting Started guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html).

## Setup

To get started, you will need a working installation of Elixir. We recommend using a version manager such as [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).

For MacOS:

```shell
$ brew install asdf
$ asdf plugin-add elixir
$ asdf install elixir
```

Then clone the repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://www.github.com/northernlabs/elixir_katas
```

## Usage

You will have to write implementations for the functions in the `ElixirKatas` project and get all the tests passing.

Run

```shell
$ mix katas
```

and follow the instructions to get started.

## Solutions

If you get stuck, you can review our solutions in the [solutions](https://github.com/NorthernLabs/elixir-katas/tree/solutions) branch:

```shell
$ git checkout solutions
```
